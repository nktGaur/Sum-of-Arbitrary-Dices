# Sum-of-Arbitrary-Dices
Code to find the most probable sum of numbers on two dices in single turn

Problem Statement :
A program to compute the most likely outcomes for the sum of two dice rolls. Assume each die has numbered faces starting at 1 and that each face has equal roll probability.

Input Conditions :
The input consists of a two integer numbers, N,M, specifying the number of faces of the two dice.

Result :
A line with the most likely outcome for the sum; in case of several outcomes with the same probability, they must be listed from lowest to highest value in separate lines.
eg. Input 1 : 6 6
    Sample Output : 7
    
    Input 2: 6 4
    Sample Output : 5
                    6
                    7
                    
    Input : 12 20
    Sample Output : 13
                    14
                    15
                    16
                    17
                    18
                    19
                    20
